Code to reproduce the images from [ggplot2 meets W. E. B. Du
Bois](https://www.statswithmatt.com/post/ggplot2-meets-w-e-b-du-bois/).
The original images can be seen at the Library of Congress, and my
corresponding scrips are named accordingly:

1.  [Proportion of freemen and slaves among American
    Negroes.](https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ppmsca.33913)
2.  [Occupations of Negroes and whites in
    Georgia.](https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ppmsca.08993)
3.  [City and rural population among American Negroes in the former
    slave states.](https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ppmsca.33914)
4.  [Conjugal condition of American Negroes according to age
    periods.](https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ppmsca.33915)

The remaining charts and other materials from the 1900 Paris Exposition
are available

I used the Inconsolata font for all text in my plots. R will probably
yell at you and/or do something weird if you run my code and don’t have
it, so you can either freely download Inconsolata
[here](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/inconsolata), or choose a
different font, or omit my choice of `font_name` altogether wherever
it’s specified.
